Part of being a [Mormon](mormon.org) is regularly speaking or teaching in church. The official [Gospel Library app](https://www.lds.org/pages/mobileapps/gospellibrary?lang=eng) makes it really simple to find resources to use in those talks and lessons. I like to have all of my content in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which makes creating and referencing the content easy. But getting the quotes into markdown is not always easy. This morning, I created a few [Workflow](https://workflow.is) recipes to simplify the process.

## Converting links

<a class="button button-blue"><span class="fa fa-cogs" href="/resources/convert-link-for-gospel-library.wflow"/><span>Convert link</span></a>

The first workflow allows you to select any text in the Gospel Library app and extracts the web link and converts it. The link start as something like this:

```
https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng
```

The workflow converts the link from a web link to a link that will open the Gospel Library app directly to the content. The converted link looks like this:

```
gospellibrary://content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng
```


## Create markdown link

<a class="button button-blue"><span class="fa fa-link" href="/resources/markdown-link-from-gospel-library.wflow"/><span>Markdown link</span></a>

The second workflow builds on the first in some important ways. One of the most important pieces is grabbing the title and creating a formatted markdown link.

The other important piece is grabbing the verses and inserting them in the link if needed. As you might notice above, a link from Gospel Library will be to the chapter of scripture, but not the verses. One note here: if you are grabbing a link to content that does not have chapter a verses, the link will not be changed.

The markdown link looks like this:

```
[Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19](gospellibrary://content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng)
```


## Extracting the entire quote

<a class="button button-blue"><span class="fa fa-quote-right" href="/resources/markdown-quote-from-gospel-library.wflow"/><span>Markdown quote</span></a>

The final piece is getting out the actual text of the quote. This last workflow uses the previous two in order to capture a formatted markdown quote. The output looks like this:

```
> 18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.
> 
> 19 And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.
> 
> [Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19](gospellibrary://content/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng)
```
