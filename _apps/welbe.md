When I was hired at [Tanner Labs](http://labs.octanner.com/), I was tasked first with being the sole iOS developer on our health and wellbeing offering, Welbe. The app had an Android and web counterpart as well as a custom backend. As I looked at the app, I immediately identified some gaps in the user experience and put together a release to improve some rough edges. Over the next year, I implemented features such as HealthKit integration, social groups and messaging, and custom graphs and charts.

A few months I was moved over to the [Align](./align) project, the company decided to partner with Virgin Mobile and to stop efforts on Welbe, so it is not currently available.
